# Introduction
I'm running a modified Prusa i3 using two e3D v6s on a Bowden setup, originally this printer was built from a reprapguru kit found [here](https://reprapguru.com/). Any and all gcode is typically made using Slicer or Cura, and modified using a text editor so the fan runs constantly.

# Headset Designs
As part of a research project, several students and I have been working with the OpenBCI Ultracortex Mark IV EEG headset. The headset frame is entirely 3D printed, but can be problematic due to the shape. I've used Blender to cut the medium headset into parts, which should aid printing on smaller machines. The use of supports is necessary with any of these headset files, and the overall headset will need to be glued together. For more information on this project, our project code can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/mahn00b/openbci_testing_e).
